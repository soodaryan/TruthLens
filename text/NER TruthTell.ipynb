The court asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to continue strict action against illegal hawkers.\n","\n","A bench of Justices Ajey S Gadkari and Kamal R Khata also raised concerns over illegal hawking near stations in suburban Mumbai including areas outside Andheri, Kandivali, Malad stations and said that it is ‘difficult to walk’ as ‘there is no street and only hawkers’. It said the situation in the suburbs is ‘complete chaos’.\n","\n","Last month, the bench had asked the BMC and state government to take strict action against the “menace” of illegal hawkers, and had remarked that not a single lane or area in the city is spared of the same.\n","\n","On Thursday, the bench questioned, “Common man walking on the street has no fundamental rights, are they only for hawkers?” and asked authorities to remove structures of unauthorised hawkers.\n","\n","The HC pulled up the authorities over ‘mushrooming’ of  illegal hawkers occuring in Flora Fountain/Hutatma Chowk area in South Mumbai and directed the police to ensure their removal, questioning them if they were ‘helpless’ to do so.\n","\n","After the BMC lawyer submitted that the civic body has sent a list of licensed hawkers, the judges asked if the said licenses still exist.
